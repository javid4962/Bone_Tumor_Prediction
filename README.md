### ABSTRACT
- Utilize Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and X-Ray images to accurately identify and classify bone tumour.
- By training the CNN algorithm with a dataset containing tumour and non-tumour images.
- Our goal is to develop a robust system.
- That can effectively differentiate between normal bone structure and those exhibiting signs of tumours.

### INTRODUCTION
- X-ray image analysis provides one of the cheapest primary screening tools for the diagnosis of bone cancer.
- The X-ray absorption rate of bone cells in the cancer- affected region differs from that in healthy bone cells.
- As a result, the image of cancer-affected bones appears in the form of a ‚Äúragged‚Äù surface.
- Progressive identification of destruction pattern in a cancer-affected bone also helps doctors to estimate the rapidity of growth of the disease, or prognosis of the treatment.

###  CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK(CNN)
- In layers of CNN, the neurons are arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth.
- Useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.¬†
- CNNs process input data, often images, by applying a series of convolutional and pooling layers. 
- Convolutional layers employ small filters to convolve across the input, detecting spatial patterns.
